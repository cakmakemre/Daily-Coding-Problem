# Challenging Programming Problems and Solutions

Get exceptionally good at coding interviews by solving a problem every day.

### What is Daily Coding Problem?

Daily Coding Problem is a simple and very useful site that emails you a coding problem every morning. This ensures that you practice consistently and often enough to stay in shape over a long period of time.

Practicing just one problem a day is enough to make a huge impact on your skill-set and confidence, especially when faced with a task that you might be facing in a top-tier tech company in the near future.

Daily Coding Problem contains a wide variety of questions inspired by real programming interviews, with in-depth solutions that clearly take you through each core concept. You'll learn about:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Hash Tables
- Binary Search Trees
- Tries
- Heaps
- Stacks and Queues
- Graphs
- Randomized Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Bit Manipulation
- Pathfinding
- Recursion
- Data Structure Design
- System Design

### Which Programming Languages?

Currently, DCP provides solutions in Python as it is very well-known and similar to pseudo-code, as well as being simple to learn. This seems to be a good choice for solutions since Python code is fairly easy to translate to other languages, given its simple syntax and straight-forward programming style.
